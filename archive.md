# Archive

This file references files and configurations that I once used, but no longer
use. They still may serve a use at some point in the future. Rather than
keeping them in the repository as a current file, I use this archive document
to reference the point right before I deleted them from the repository. This
makes things simpler for me when trying to find old code, compared with
searching through git history to find what I am looking for.
